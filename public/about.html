<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi!, My name is Victoria, a web developer in training eager for you to see these projects and all the ones to come, so you can see what I am capable of,</p>

<p>I love web development because it combines creativity and logic, and I am excited to keep growing and building meaningful projects.</p>

<p>Outside of programming, I am a horror movie geek, I am looking forward to a career where I can turn ideas into seamless digital experiences.</p>
